# hello-world

Hey guys!

I'm Luis and I like programming, but actually I am pretty new at it and I joined, since my increasing interests, the GitHub because while searching through the Internet for programming blogs or websites, whatever, I found the codeconquest.com, which introduced me to this fancy programming community! I'm so excited and realized that I finally can dig into programming...

Anyways, I'm brasilian and 17 years old and plan to study in Germany next year. I really don't know if I want to work at a gaming-related company, at a start-up or even at a research labboratory in TUB (Technische Universit√§t Berlin).

My email is: lh.paoletti@gmail.com if you may want to contact me or anything.
